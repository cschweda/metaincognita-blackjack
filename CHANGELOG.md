## [Unreleased]

### Added (0.3.0 — training surfaces)
- Advisor with three intensities (coach / feedback / exam): live recommendation + EV table,
  per-decision grading with mistake cost, deviation-aware at the count (Illustrious 18 + Fab 4,
  advanced toggle), insurance advice, side-bet caution
- Hi-Lo counting: presented-card running count, half-deck true count, self-check (C key),
  shuffle quizzes, count survives mid-round refresh
- History page (per-decision ✓/✗ vs book, cost, RC/TC, expandable EV tables) and Analysis page
  (adherence by category, top mistakes, EV lost vs actual P&L, count accuracy, side-bet ledger,
  bankroll sparkline, bot P&L)
- Learn page: interactive strategy chart generated from the engine (tap any cell for the EV math),
  rules lab with live house-edge deltas, Hi-Lo primer + deviation tables, official side-bet pay
  tables, myths, casino-procedure guide, glossary
- Drills: Strategy Flash (mistake-weighted), Count the Cards (3 speeds × 3 group sizes),
  True-Count Conversion, Deviation Quiz — bests persisted for life
- Study mode hotspots, training nav, pit-boss milestones, myth quips, payout flash, mobile pass
  (bots collapse to status chips), a11y fixes, Playwright E2E suite, Netlify deploy config
- Lifetime training stats under `blackjack-training-v1` (survive leaving the table)

### Changed (0.3.0)
- `Deviation.play` union gains `'surrender'`; `deviationFor` accepts a deviation pool
- Side-bet pay-table constants exported for the learn page

### Added (0.2.0 — playable game)
- Setup screen: five rulebook-cited presets with model-estimate house edges, full custom rules
  editor with engine validation, bot companion picker, bankroll/mode/speed selection
- Playable table: SVG felt with rules-driven arc text, paced casino-procedure dealing or instant
  quick play, chip betting with side-bet circles, insurance/even-money flow, keyboard play
  (H/S/D/P/R, B rebet, Space deal), bot companions acting and talking at the table
- Session persistence (`blackjack-session-v1`): bankroll, capped 500-round history, settings,
  and mid-round snapshots — a refresh restores the exact table (engine snapshot/restore with
  RNG continuity)
- Engine additions: `statefulMulberry32`, `Shoe.snapshot/restore` + `discardCount`,
  `BlackjackGame.snapshot/restore`, `hole-revealed` and `insurance-settled` events

### Added
- Project scaffold (Nuxt 4 family stack, craps-skeleton conventions)
- Pure TypeScript blackjack engine (`app/utils/engine/`): cards/shoe with burn + cut-card
  penetration, rulebook-cited rule presets (MA 205 CMR / Bally's AC / WA / Vegas Strip / single-deck 6:5),
  computed basic-strategy EV engine pinned to canonical charts, Hi-Lo counting with Illustrious 18,
  four side bets with official pay tables (21+3, Lucky Ladies, Match the Dealer, Buster),
  event-emitting round engine, five bot personas
- Statistical simulation test: 200k seeded rounds verify empirical house edge against theory
